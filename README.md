# 21-School-Unity-Starter-Project

The goal of a project is to create simple, but fully worked video game =)

The concept:
2D platformer with a character, simple level (maybe several),
ability to move, collect some objects, count this objects, and
finishing the level.

Please, do not add big files to the repo. It can contain 1Gb max, overall.
